# SkyBooking
SkyBooking is a comprehensive travel booking platform that allows users to search for both flights and hotel rooms, make reservations, and manage their travel details seamlessly. The system includes user registration, login functionality, and a personalized passenger profile to store essential details for both flights and hotel bookings. Users can filter flight and hotel options based on preferences such as date, destination, price, and star rating, and confirm their bookings through a simulated payment process. Administrators have the ability to manage flight schedules, hotel availability, and bookings through an intuitive admin panel. Booking history for both flights and hotels is accessible to users, and notifications keep them informed of their reservation status. Additionally, the platform generates booking confirmations and provides downloadable tickets or vouchers for both flights and hotel stays.
